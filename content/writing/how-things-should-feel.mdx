We spend so much time talking about how things look. The color palette. The grid. The typeface. The border-radius. These are the conversations I have every day as a designer, and they matter. But they're not the first question.

The first question should always be: how should this *feel*?

## Feeling before form

When I start a new project, I don't open Figma. I don't browse Dribbble. I don't look at competitor websites. Instead, I sit with the question: if this thing were a room, what would it feel like to walk into it?

Would it be warm or cool? Bright or dim? Would there be music playing, or silence? Would the furniture be soft or angular? Would you want to stay for hours, or just pass through?

These aren't design decisions. Not yet. They're *feeling* decisions. And they inform everything that comes after.

## The test

Here's a test I apply to everything I make: if someone experiences it for the first time, will they have a feeling before they have a thought? Will they *feel* something before they start analyzing the grid or noticing the typography?

If yes, the design is working.

If no, it's just decoration.

The best websites, the best books, the best spaces — they all pass this test. You walk in and something shifts in you before you understand why. The meaning arrives through the body, not the mind.

## What this means practically

It means I spend the first week of any project not designing anything. I'm collecting references — not visual references, but sensory ones. A photograph of light through curtains. A recording of rain on a window. The feeling of a specific linen texture. The weight of a well-made book in your hands.

These become the foundation. When I eventually open my design tools, I'm not making aesthetic decisions. I'm translating feelings into form. And that translation, when it works, is what makes design feel inevitable rather than arbitrary.

## The quiet confidence

The designs I admire most are the ones that aren't trying to impress you. They're not performing. They're not desperate for your attention. They simply exist, with a quiet confidence that says: "This is what I am. Take your time."

That's the feeling I'm always chasing. Not wow. Not clever. Just *right.*
