The most powerful element in any composition isn't a color, a typeface, or an image. It's the space where you chose to put nothing.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately — about how the best designs are the ones that know when to stop. Where the designer had the discipline to leave the canvas unfinished. Where there's room for the viewer to bring something of their own.

## The weight of nothing

In music, the rests between notes aren't absences. They're structural. The silence shapes the melody as much as the sound does. John Cage understood this. Miles Davis built a career on it.

Design works the same way. The margins around a paragraph aren't empty space — they're the frame that makes the words readable. The gap between two elements isn't wasted real estate — it's the breathing room that gives each element its identity.

## What we remove

When I start a new project, I always begin with too much. Too many colors, too many typefaces, too many ideas competing for attention. The work isn't in the adding. The work is in the removing.

Every element that survives the editing process earns its place. It's there because without it, something would be missing. Not because it's decorative or impressive or on-trend. Because it's *necessary*.

This is the difference between minimalism as an aesthetic and minimalism as a practice. The aesthetic is easy — just use lots of white space and a sans-serif font. The practice is hard. It requires you to understand why each element exists and to be honest about whether it's serving the work or serving your ego.

## A room with one window

I keep coming back to this image: a room with white walls, wooden floors, and one large window. Nothing on the walls. No furniture except a single chair facing the window. The light comes in and changes throughout the day. In the morning it's cool and sharp. In the afternoon it's warm and golden. In the evening it's long shadows and amber.

The room doesn't need anything else. The light is the design. The emptiness is what makes the light visible.

That's what I want my work to feel like. Not empty. *Clear.*
