There's a difference between looking at something and seeing it. Looking is fast — a glance, a scan, a quick assessment. Seeing is slow. It requires you to stop, to stay, to let the thing reveal itself to you on its own schedule.

I've been trying to practice slow seeing. Not as a productivity technique or a creative exercise, but as a way of being in the world.

## What slow seeing looks like

Last Tuesday I spent forty-five minutes looking at a single wall in my apartment. It's a white wall — or at least, I always thought it was white. But when I really looked, I noticed it wasn't white at all. It was the faintest warm gray near the floor, where the baseboard casts a shadow. It was almost blue near the ceiling, reflecting the sky through the window. In the corner, where two walls meet, there was a line of light so thin and sharp it looked drawn with a pencil.

Forty-five minutes for a wall. And I could have gone longer.

## Why this matters for design

Designers are supposed to be visual people. We're supposed to *see things*. But I think most of us, most of the time, are just looking. We're scanning references, scrolling through feeds, glancing at layouts. We're consuming visual information at the same speed we consume everything else.

Slow seeing is different. It's what happens when you give something permission to be complex. When you stop trying to categorize it or compare it to something else and just let it be what it is.

## The practice

I've started doing this with designed objects too. I'll take a single book — just the physical object — and spend twenty minutes with it. Not reading it. Just holding it. Feeling the weight. Looking at how the pages sit. Noticing the gap between the spine and the cover. The way the cloth texture catches light differently at different angles.

Every time I do this, I notice something I missed before. A decision some designer made that I would have scrolled right past. A subtle curve, a particular shade, a moment of restraint where someone chose *not* to add something.

These invisible decisions are where the real craft lives.

## Slow seeing, slow making

I'm starting to believe that the speed at which you see directly affects the quality of what you make. If you see fast, you make fast. And fast making has a particular quality — it's competent, sometimes clever, but it rarely surprises you. It rarely has the feeling of inevitability.

Slow making — the kind that comes from slow seeing — feels different. It feels like the thing was *discovered* rather than invented. Like it was always there, waiting for someone patient enough to find it.

That's the kind of work I want to make. The kind that waited.
