Aether is a quarterly journal about architecture, silence, and the spaces between things.

The brief was open: make it feel like the magazine itself is a room you want to stay in. I worked on art direction across four issues, establishing a grid system that uses negative space as aggressively as it uses imagery.

Each spread is designed with one rule: if you removed the text, the layout should still feel intentional. And if you removed the images, the typography should still be beautiful.

The paper stock is uncoated, slightly warm. The ink sits on the surface with a matte finish. When you hold an issue, it feels like holding a letter someone wrote by hand.
