Meridian came to me with a simple question: what does balance look like?

They were building a wellness studio in the middle of a busy city and wanted everything about their space — the signage, the website, the towels, the water bottles — to feel like a deep breath.

We started with typography. I chose a serif that felt warm without being precious, paired with a sans-serif that disappeared when you were reading. The logomark is a single line — a horizon — that subtly curves. You almost don't notice the curve until someone points it out.

The color palette is drawn from early morning light. Warm whites, the faintest blush, a stone gray that feels like it belongs in a Japanese garden.

Everything was designed to feel inevitable. Like it couldn't have been any other way.
