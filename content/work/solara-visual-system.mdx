Solara designs buildings that breathe. Their architecture responds to light, wind, and the rhythm of the people inside. They needed a visual identity that carried the same philosophy.

The identity system is built around a single geometric principle: the golden angle. The logomark, the grid system, the proportions of every printed piece — all derived from the same mathematical relationship that governs sunflower seeds and galaxy spirals.

But none of that is visible to the casual observer. What they see is a mark that feels right. Colors that feel like they belong together. Typography that reads like a calm conversation.

The best design systems are like that. The logic is deep, the surface is effortless.
