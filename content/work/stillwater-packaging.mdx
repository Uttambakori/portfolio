Stillwater makes ceramics by hand in a small studio overlooking a river. Every piece takes weeks. Nothing is rushed.

The packaging needed to honor that pace. I designed a system using unbleached kraft paper, a single-color stamp, and hand-tied cotton twine. The label typography is set in a warm serif at a size that makes you lean in to read it.

There are no barcodes on the front. No ingredient lists competing for attention. Just the name, the piece, and a small mark that says "made slowly."

The unboxing experience is intentionally quiet. Paper unfolds. The ceramic is nested in linen. You find a small card with a handwritten note. Nothing screams. Everything whispers.
